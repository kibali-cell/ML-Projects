# ML-Projects

Welcome to the **ML-Projects** repository by kibali-cell! This collection features a variety of hands-on machine learning projects with step-by-step tutorials, designed to help learners and developers master data science, deep learning, and AI through practical applications.

## Overview

This repository includes projects covering key machine learning domains such as:

- **Predictive Analytics**: Build models to forecast trends and outcomes.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Create systems for text analysis and language understanding.
- **Computer Vision**: Develop solutions for image recognition and processing.

Each project comes with clear tutorials, code, and datasets to guide you through implementation and experimentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow` or `pytorch`, `nltk` (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Basic understanding of Python and machine learning concepts

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kibali-cell/ML-Projects.git
   cd ML-Projects
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Explore the project folders and follow the individual `README.md` files for specific setup instructions.

## Project Structure
- `/datasets`: Sample datasets used in the projects.

## Usage
1. Navigate to a project folder (e.g., `cd nlp/sentiment_analysis`).
2. Follow the tutorial in the folder's `README.md` or Jupyter notebook.
3. Run the code:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   or open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
   ```
